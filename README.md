# SingularityCardGame

This is a Digital Implementation for the structure of the Singularity Card Game. 

Created by Jeremy Wen and Tyler Moy
Williams College — CSCI 136: Data Structures and Advanced Programming (Spring 2025)

Overview:

Singularity is a custom, unconventional card game played physically by a small but passionate community. There are a plethora of games built into the card game and this project brings Singularity into a digital format, offering a structured framework that others can use, enjoy, and build on.

We’re two students from Williams College who set out to design something that’s both fun and functional, especially for a game that previously existed only in scattered formats. By building this project in Java (and optionally using Unity for visual rendering), we aim to make Singularity more accessible, organized, and ready for experimentation.

Some Of Our Goals:

Provide a visual digital version of the Singularity game board and logic
Allow others to grow from on our implementation through sleek code and documentation
Bring structure to an unstructured game while preserving creative flexibility
Utilize bitboards to efficiently track card positions, player control, and tile-based interactions given complex zones/rules
